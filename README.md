We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts.
Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting.

We provide the **evaluation code** in this repository. 

Moreover, you can visit our [Demo Page](https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo) for the audio samples of our dataset as well as the results of our model.

## Updates

- 2025.07: We released the evaluation code of MRSDrama!
- 2025.07: We released the full dataset of MRSDrama!
- 2025.07: ISDrama is accepted by ACMMM 2025!

## TODO List

âœ… Release the evaluation code.

âœ… Release the full dataset.

ðŸ”² Release the main model code.

## Key Features

- We develop MRSDrama, the first **multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset**, accompanying videos, scripts, alignments, positions, and textual prompts.
- We introduce ISDrama, the first **immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting**. We design the **Multimodal Pose Encoder** to extract pose from multimodal inputs, while the **Immersive Drama Transformer** produces binaural speech.
- Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics.

### Data Architecture

Our dataset is organized hierarchically. 

Each top-level folder contains a set of dramas. Each folder contains a subfolder with cut WAV files, an MP4 video file, and a JSON file containing all annotation information.
